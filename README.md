# Fizz Buzz

> Fizz Buzz is a classic game used to teach kids about multiples and division. It helps people grasp these concepts in a fun and engaging way. It also improves focus and memory on the counting and remember the rules. Fizz Buzz is just fun! To start playing one player starts counting from 1.
- Instead of saying the number, players have to say:
"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
"FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by BOTH 3 and 5.

NOTE - you can change the dividing numbers as you want.
